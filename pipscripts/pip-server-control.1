.B /etc/s9s-cmon-test/*.host
Individual config file for hosts, one file for every host. Here is an example
for such a configuration file.

.nf
CONF_HOST_NAME="Host12"
CONF_HOST_URL="https://host12:1311"
CONF_HOST_CATEGORY="Hosts"
CONF_HOST_MAC=""
CONF_HOST_DATA_ROOT=""
CONF_HOST_USER=""
CONF_HOST_AUTO_UPDATE_WORKER=""
.fi

.RS 7
.TP
.B CONF_HOST_CATEGORY
A short name to put the servers into groups, to categorize them.

.TP
.B CONF_HOST_CONTAINERS
The list of permanent containers. This is not the list of containers but the
containers that should be there and should be managed (e.g. by archiving them).

.TP
.B CONF_HOST_MAC
The MAC address of the host. This is used to send wakeonlan packets when
starting up the host.

.TP
.B CONF_HOST_NAME 
The name of the host. This will be used when a host is printed in a short format
for lists, widgets.

.TP
.B CONF_HOST_PDU
The name of the PDU (or names of the PDUs with ',' as separator) to turn the
power on and off.

.TP
.B CONF_HOST_PROTECTED
If this value is a non-empty string no batch jobs should be sent to the server
and powering off should be restricted.

.TP
.B CONF_HOST_URL
An URL for the host management system if there is one. This should bring up a
web page to configure the host HW and SW.

.TP
.B CONF_HOST_VIRTUAL
If this value is a non-empty string the server is actually a virtual machine and
should be handled accordingly. Statistics are not aggregated from these hosts
since their resources are already considered when the parent server is checked.
.RE

.TP
.B CONF_HOST_DATA_ROOT
Test data root directory on CONF_HOST_NAME host. Same value as the host's
PROJECT_DATA_ROOT config value.

.TP
.B CONF_HOST_USER
The OS user name that owns the CONF_HOST_DATA_ROOT on the host. The running
pip-test-daemon should have ssh access to this user on the CONF_HOST_NAME host.

.TP
.B CONF_HOST_AUTO_UPDATE_WORKER
Whether the manager mode of pip-test-daemon should upgrade itself on the worker
hosts. For this it pulls new s9s source, deletes old test logs and
pip-test-daemon log, then restarts pip-test-daemon service on the worker before
giving it task by copiing a schedule file to the worker host.

WARNING: the feature is hacky for now, it requires that the value for
PROJECT_S9S_TESTORIGIN_DIR is the same on both the worker and the manager hosts.


.\"
.\" Descrption of the *.hostinfo files.
.\"
.TP
.B $PROJECT_DATA_ROOT/servers/*.hostinfo

are created by the \fBpip-host-control\fp program. Here is an example:

.nf

DISK_GIGABYTES=559
NUMBER_OF_CONTAINERS=8
